Never get snagged on your castle gates, longhouse doors, or dungeon entrances again! **DoorOpenerBruh** automatically swings open doors, gates, and drawbridges as you approach, and gently closes them behind you once you depart.

---

## 🚪 How It Works

* 🚶 **Automatic Approach & Departure**: Walk up to any supported door, gate, or drawbridge and it will seamlessly open for you. Walk away and it securely closes behind you.
* 🏰 **Full Biome & Structure Support**: Works with standard Wood and Iron doors, Darkwood gates, Ashlands doors and gates, and massive Timberwood and Rustic drawbridges!
* 🗝️ **Key & Crypt Recognition**: Automatically opens locked crypt and dungeon doors if the player carries the matching key in their inventory or equipped backpack.
* 🛡️ **Ward & Private Area Respect**: Safely respects player wards—doors inside private protected zones will only open for authorized Vikings.

---

## 📦 Supported Door & Gate Types

| Structure | Biome / Tier | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wood & Log Doors** | 🌸 Meadows / 🌲 Black Forest | Basic residential doors and gates. |
| **Iron Doors & Gates** | 🐸 Swamp | Sturdy iron fortification gates. |
| **Darkwood Gates** | 🌾 Plains | Decorative and high-durability double gates. |
| **Ashwood & Flametal Gates** | 🔥 Ashlands | Heavy molten fortification gates and Ashwood doors. |
| **Grausten Doors & Gates** | 🔥 Ashlands | Ancient volcanic stone doors and portcullises. |
| **Timberwood & Rustic Drawbridges** | 🏰 Fortress / Base | Massive multi-panel drawbridges with collision bounds awareness. |
| **Crypt & Burial Chamber Doors** | ⚔️ Dungeons | Key-validated dungeon and crypt entryways. |

## ⚙️ Configuration & Settings

Fine-tune global toggles and per-door behavior in the in-game [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) (<kbd>F1</kbd>):

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enable Mod** | `true` | Globally toggles automatic door opening and closing. |
| **Open Distance** | `3.0m` | Proximity distance in meters required to trigger door opening. |
| **Close Distance** | `5.0m` | Departure distance in meters required to trigger door closing. |
| **Respect Wards** | `true` | Prevents unauthorized doors in active ward areas from opening. |
| **Auto Open Crypts** | `true` | Allows dungeon/crypt doors to open automatically if the player carries the key. |
| **Per-Door Toggles** | `true` *(All)* | Individual enable/disable toggles for every door type in the game. |

---

## 🛡️ Advanced Mechanics & Safeguards

* 🌉 **Drawbridge Bounds Detection**: Utilizes collider-aware bounding box checks across large drawbridges to guarantee the bridge never auto-closes while you are actively traversing it.
* 🔄 **Multiplayer Synchronization**: Fully synchronizes open/close states across dedicated server clients with zero door desynchronization.
* ⚡ **Zero Lag Overhead**: Replaced legacy continuous polling with proximity distance triggers for instant, smooth response.
