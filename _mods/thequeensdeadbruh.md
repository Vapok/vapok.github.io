You braved the infested mines, climbed the ancient citadel, and drove your blade through the heart of the Seeker Queen. Shouldn't the suffocating mist of the Mistlands finally lift? **The Queen's Dead Bruh!** ties world progression directly to your triumph—clearing away the blinding mist once The Queen has been defeated!

---

## 👑 How It Works

* ⚔️ **Boss Defeat Progression**: Once The Queen boss is slain for the first time on a world or dedicated server, the mod detects the global world key and dissipates the thick Mistlands mist.
* 🌫️ **Configurable Mist Scaling**: Server admins and players can programmatically configure mist density anywhere from 0% (fully clear vistas) to 100% (vanilla mist).
* 🏰 **Rewarding End-Game Exploration**: Turn the jagged peaks, glowing ancient roots, and Dvergr fortresses into breathtaking, unobstructed vistas for base building and exploration.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration & Settings

Configure via the in-game [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) (<kbd>F1</kbd>) or in `TheQueensDeadBruh.cfg`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enable Mod** | `true` | Globally toggles the mist clearing mechanics. |
| **Mist Density Factor** | `0.0` *(Fully Clear)* | Target mist transparency after The Queen's defeat (`0.0` = completely clear, `1.0` = full vanilla mist). |

---

## 🛡️ Advanced Safeguards

* ⚡ **Zero Performance Impact**: Completely eliminates per-frame scene searches in favor of direct world-state event triggers.
* 🌐 **ServerSync Enforced**: On dedicated servers, the defeat status and mist scaling factors are locked and synchronized from the server to all connected players.
