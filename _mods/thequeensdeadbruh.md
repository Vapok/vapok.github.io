You braved the infested mines, climbed the ancient citadel, and drove your blade through the heart of the Seeker Queen. Shouldn't the suffocating mist of the Mistlands finally lift? **The Queen's Dead Bruh!** ties world progression directly to your triumph—clearing away the blinding mist once The Queen has been defeated!

## 👑 How It Works

* ⚔️ **Boss Defeat Progression**: Once The Queen boss is slain for the first time on a world or dedicated server, the mod detects the global world key and dissipates the thick Mistlands mist.
* 🌫️ **Configurable Mist Scaling**: Server admins and players can programmatically configure mist density anywhere from 0% (fully clear vistas) to 100% (vanilla mist).
* 🏰 **Rewarding End-Game Exploration**: Turn the jagged peaks, glowing ancient roots, and Dvergr fortresses into breathtaking, unobstructed vistas for base building and exploration.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration & Settings

Configure via the in-game [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) (<kbd>F1</kbd>) or in `TheQueensDeadBruh.cfg`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enable Mod** | `true` | Globally toggles the mist clearing mechanics. |
| **Mist Density Factor** | `0.0` *(Fully Clear)* | Target mist transparency after The Queen's defeat (`0.0` = completely clear, `1.0` = full vanilla mist). |

---

## 🛡️ Advanced Safeguards

* ⚡ **Zero Performance Impact**: Completely eliminates per-frame scene searches in favor of direct world-state event triggers.
* 🌐 **ServerSync Enforced**: On dedicated servers, the defeat status and mist scaling factors are locked and synchronized from the server to all connected players.

## 📥 Installation & Server Setup

### Mod Manager (Recommended)
1. Install via **R2ModMan** or **Thunderstore Mod Manager**.
2. Dependencies (`BepInExPack`, `Jotunn (JVL)`) are installed automatically.

### Dedicated Servers
* **Client & Server Required**: The mod should be installed on both the server and clients to ensure synchronized world progression across all players.

## 🔒 Anonymous Telemetry, Error Reporting & Privacy

TheQueensDeadBruh includes lightweight, privacy-first telemetry and error reporting to help monitor mod stability, diagnose unhandled bugs, and track active version adoption across game updates.

* **100% Anonymous**: We never collect personal data, Steam IDs, IP addresses, character/world names, or file system paths. Stack traces from errors are automatically sanitized to strip local user directories.
* **Granular Player Control**:
  * **Anonymous Telemetry (Opt-In)**: Tracks version adoption and session launches. Defaults to **unchecked / disabled** when first loaded (`Enable Anonymous Telemetry = false`).
  * **Error Reporting (Opt-Out)**: Captures sanitized mod crash diagnostics to rapidly identify and fix bugs. Defaults to **enabled** (`Send Error Reports = true`) with one-click opt-out.
  * **Data Disclaimers**: Hover over any toggle in the startup modal for interactive tooltip disclaimers detailing exactly what data is transmitted.
* **In-Game & Online Privacy Policy**: The full privacy policy can be viewed directly in-game by clicking **`[ PRIVACY POLICY ]`** on the startup splash modal, or online at [vapok.io/privacy-policy](https://vapok.io/privacy-policy/).
* **Configuration Files**: Settings can be managed in-game via the startup modal, through the BepInEx Configuration Manager, or under `[Local Config]` in `BepInEx/config/vapok.mods.thequeensdeadbruh.cfg`.
