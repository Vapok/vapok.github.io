## What's New in XPortal Networks

XPortal Networks builds upon the solid foundation of the original XPortal mod by SpikeHimself, expanding it into a dedicated networking framework with extensive multiplayer features and numerous bug fixes:

* **Portal Networks**: Group portals into distinct networks:
  * **Global / Public Network**: Accessible to all players on the server.
  * **Player Networks & Private Portals**: Portals tied to individual players. Toggle the **Private** setting so unauthorized players cannot view or teleport through your personal portals.
  * **Custom Named Networks**: Define up to 15 server-wide custom networks (such as *Trade Hub*, *Clan Base*, *Mining Outposts*, or *Admin Only*) via configuration, complete with real-time hot-reloading.
* **Server Admin & Permission Controls**: Configurable permissions allowing server admins to manage networks and prevent non-owners from deconstructing portals.
* **Bug Fixes & Modernization**:
  * Upgraded for the latest Valheim versions and .NET Framework 4.8.
  * Resolved controller UI legend and navigation issues.
  * Fixed dedicated server admin destruction and permission edge-cases.
  * Enhanced ZDO network synchronization and reconnection reliability.

## Features

### 🌐 Destination Selection Menu
When interacting with a portal, a clean UI opens allowing you to select your target destination from a dropdown menu. The list displays:
* The destination portal name
* Distance to the destination (in meters)
* Portal light color indicator (when paired with mods like Advanced Portals or Stone Portal)

### 🔒 Public, Private & Custom Networks
Organize your world’s transportation:
* **Global Network**: The shared network open to everyone.
* **Personal Network**: Portals automatically grouped under your character.
* **Private Portals**: Mark sensitive portals as private so other players cannot use or retarget them.
* **Custom Named Networks**: Admin-defined channels defined in `xportal_networks.json` that organize portals by faction, region, or purpose.

### ⭐ Default Portal Destination
You can set a portal as your **Default Portal**. Newly constructed portals will immediately link to your default portal automatically, saving you time when setting up forward operating bases.

### 🏷️ Uncapped Portal Name Length
XPortal Networks removes the vanilla character limit on portal tags, allowing you to give your portals descriptive and memorable names.

### 📍 Ping Portal on Map
Forgot where a portal leads? Click the **Ping** button to highlight the destination portal directly on your map and alert your fellow adventurers with a map ping.

### 🎮 Full Gamepad & Controller Support
Fully navigable using controllers with integrated on-screen key hints:

| Button (Xbox / PlayStation) | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **A** / **Cross** | Confirm / Submit portal configuration |
| **B** / **Circle** | Cancel / Close menu |
| **Y** / **Triangle** | Ping selected destination on map |
| **X** / **Square** | Open / close destination dropdown list |
| **D-Pad Up / Down** | Navigate destination list |

## Configuration

### General & Server Settings
The main configuration file is located at `BepInEx/config/vapok.mods.xportalnetworks.cfg`. Server-enforced settings will automatically synchronize from the server to connected clients via ServerSync.

| Setting | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`PingMapDisabled`** | *Server Enforced* | Disables map pinging for servers playing with `nomap` or immersive navigation rules. |
| **`HidePortalDistance`** | *Server Enforced* | Hides the meter distance displayed next to portal names in the dropdown. |
| **`DoublePortalCosts`** | *Server Enforced* | Doubles portal crafting costs to balance the convenience of one-to-many portal routing. |
| **`RestrictPortalRemoval`** | *Server Enforced* | Restricts deconstructing/destroying portals to the original creator or server admins. |
| **`DisplayPortalColour`** | *Client Config* | Displays colored indicators matching portal types in the menu. |

### Custom Named Networks (`xportal_networks.json`)
Servers can define custom networks by editing `BepInEx/config/XPortalNetworks/xportal_networks.json`. Changes to this file are automatically detected and reloaded live without needing to restart the server:

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "name": "Admin Network" },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Trade Hub" },
  { "id": 3, "name": "North Outposts" }
]
```
*(Supports network IDs 1 through 15).*

## 🔒 Anonymous Telemetry, Error Reporting & Privacy

XPortalNetworks includes lightweight, privacy-first telemetry and error reporting to help monitor mod stability, diagnose unhandled bugs, and track active version adoption across game updates.

* **100% Anonymous**: We never collect personal data, Steam IDs, IP addresses, character/world names, or file system paths. Stack traces from errors are automatically sanitized to strip local user directories.
* **Granular Player Control**:
  * **Anonymous Telemetry (Opt-In)**: Tracks version adoption and session launches. Defaults to **unchecked / disabled** when first loaded (`Enable Anonymous Telemetry = false`).
  * **Error Reporting (Opt-Out)**: Captures sanitized mod crash diagnostics to rapidly identify and fix bugs. Defaults to **enabled** (`Send Error Reports = true`) with one-click opt-out.
  * **Data Disclaimers**: Hover over any toggle in the startup modal for interactive tooltip disclaimers detailing exactly what data is transmitted.
* **In-Game & Online Privacy Policy**: The full privacy policy can be viewed directly in-game by clicking **`[ PRIVACY POLICY ]`** on the startup splash modal, or online at [vapok.io/privacy-policy](https://vapok.io/privacy-policy/).
* **Configuration Files**: Settings can be managed in-game via the startup modal, through the BepInEx Configuration Manager, or under `[Local Config]` in `BepInEx/config/vapok.mods.xportalnetworks.cfg`.
