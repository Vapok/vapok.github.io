Gone are the days of yelling in chat for everyone to sprint to bed or log off just to make the dark, perilous night pass. **Better Sleep Bruh!** introduces dynamic time acceleration to Valheim: the more players resting in bed on a multiplayer server, the faster night ticks away!

## 🌙 How It Works

* 💤 **Proportional Acceleration**: Nighttime automatically accelerates proportionally to the percentage of players currently sleeping in beds.
* 🛌 **No 100% Requirement**: If some players are out sailing on a longship, mining in a crypt, or AFK, players back at base can still sleep to significantly speed up the night.
* 🪶 **On-Screen Pillow HUD**: An intuitive on-screen HUD displays pillow icons for all connected players, lighting up in real time as Vikings tuck themselves into bed.
* 🌅 **Smooth Morning Ramp-Down**: Time speed smoothly transitions back to 1x as dawn approaches so you never get jolted awake.

### 📊 Sleep Speed Example

| Players Connected | Players in Bed | Active Speed Bonus | Nighttime Experience |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **5** | **5 (100%)** | **100%** | Full vanilla dream state; instant skip to morning. |
| **5** | **4 (80%)** | **80%** | Blazing-fast night progression. |
| **5** | **3 (60%)** | **60%** | Fast night acceleration while miners/sailors continue working. |
| **5** | **1 (20%)** | **20%** | Noticeable time speedup for the solo sleeper. |
| **5** | **0 (0%)** | **0%** | Normal vanilla passage of time. |

## ⚙️ Configuration & Settings

Configure via the in-game [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) (<kbd>F1</kbd>) or in `BetterSleepBruh.cfg`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sleep Start Hour** | `12.0` *(Noon)* | Earliest in-game time of day when players are permitted to sleep. |
| **Bonus Increment Scale** | `20x` | Multiplier scaling the speed bonus per sleeping player. |
| **Boost Fade Duration** | `3.0s` | Seconds before morning when time acceleration ramps down to standard speed. |
| **Use Vanilla Start Sleep** | `false` | When enabled, enforces standard vanilla nighttime sleep eligibility checks. |
| **Enable Testing Mode** | `false` | Developer testing mode to simulate connected and sleeping players. |

---

## 🛡️ Advanced Safeguards

* 🖥️ **Server-Driven Operation**: Time calculations run strictly on the server. Clients do not need the mod installed to benefit from sleep acceleration (the client mod is only required for the on-screen Pillow HUD).
* 🔄 **Smooth Environment Sync**: Weather, skybox lighting, and day counters transition smoothly across all clients without stutter or desync.
* 🌐 **ServerSync Enforced**: Configuration parameters are managed by server admins and synced to all clients automatically.

## 📥 Installation & Server Setup

### Mod Manager (Recommended)
1. Install via **R2ModMan** or **Thunderstore Mod Manager**.
2. Dependencies (`BepInExPack`, `Jotunn (JVL)`) are installed automatically.

### Dedicated Servers
* **Server Installation**: Place the DLL on the dedicated server to enable sleep acceleration for all players.
* **Client Installation (Optional)**: Recommended for players who want to see the visual on-screen Pillow HUD.

## 🔒 Anonymous Telemetry, Error Reporting & Privacy

BetterSleepBruh includes lightweight, privacy-first telemetry and error reporting to help monitor mod stability, diagnose unhandled bugs, and track active version adoption across game updates.

* **100% Anonymous**: We never collect personal data, Steam IDs, IP addresses, character/world names, or file system paths. Stack traces from errors are automatically sanitized to strip local user directories.
* **Granular Player Control**:
  * **Anonymous Telemetry (Opt-In)**: Tracks version adoption and session launches. Defaults to **unchecked / disabled** when first loaded (`Enable Anonymous Telemetry = false`).
  * **Error Reporting (Opt-Out)**: Captures sanitized mod crash diagnostics to rapidly identify and fix bugs. Defaults to **enabled** (`Send Error Reports = true`) with one-click opt-out.
  * **Data Disclaimers**: Hover over any toggle in the startup modal for interactive tooltip disclaimers detailing exactly what data is transmitted.
* **In-Game & Online Privacy Policy**: The full privacy policy can be viewed directly in-game by clicking **`[ PRIVACY POLICY ]`** on the startup splash modal, or online at [vapok.io/privacy-policy](https://vapok.io/privacy-policy/).
* **Configuration Files**: Settings can be managed in-game via the startup modal, through the BepInEx Configuration Manager, or under `[Local Config]` in `BepInEx/config/vapok.mods.BetterSleepBruh.cfg`.
