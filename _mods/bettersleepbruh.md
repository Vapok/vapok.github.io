Gone are the days of yelling in chat for everyone to sprint to bed or log off just to make the dark, perilous night pass. **Better Sleep Bruh!** introduces dynamic time acceleration to Valheim: the more players resting in bed on a multiplayer server, the faster night ticks away!

---

## 🌙 How It Works

* 💤 **Proportional Acceleration**: Nighttime automatically accelerates proportionally to the percentage of players currently sleeping in beds.
* 🛌 **No 100% Requirement**: If some players are out sailing on a longship, mining in a crypt, or AFK, players back at base can still sleep to significantly speed up the night.
* 🪶 **On-Screen Pillow HUD**: An intuitive on-screen HUD displays pillow icons for all connected players, lighting up in real time as Vikings tuck themselves into bed.
* 🌅 **Smooth Morning Ramp-Down**: Time speed smoothly transitions back to 1x as dawn approaches so you never get jolted awake.

### 📊 Sleep Speed Example

| Players Connected | Players in Bed | Active Speed Bonus | Nighttime Experience |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **5** | **5 (100%)** | **100%** | Full vanilla dream state; instant skip to morning. |
| **5** | **4 (80%)** | **80%** | Blazing-fast night progression. |
| **5** | **3 (60%)** | **60%** | Fast night acceleration while miners/sailors continue working. |
| **5** | **1 (20%)** | **20%** | Noticeable time speedup for the solo sleeper. |
| **5** | **0 (0%)** | **0%** | Normal vanilla passage of time. |

## ⚙️ Configuration & Settings

Configure via the in-game [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) (<kbd>F1</kbd>) or in `BetterSleepBruh.cfg`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sleep Start Hour** | `12.0` *(Noon)* | Earliest in-game time of day when players are permitted to sleep. |
| **Bonus Increment Scale** | `20x` | Multiplier scaling the speed bonus per sleeping player. |
| **Boost Fade Duration** | `3.0s` | Seconds before morning when time acceleration ramps down to standard speed. |
| **Use Vanilla Start Sleep** | `false` | When enabled, enforces standard vanilla nighttime sleep eligibility checks. |
| **Enable Testing Mode** | `false` | Developer testing mode to simulate connected and sleeping players. |

---

## 🛡️ Advanced Safeguards

* 🖥️ **Server-Driven Operation**: Time calculations run strictly on the server. Clients do not need the mod installed to benefit from sleep acceleration (the client mod is only required for the on-screen Pillow HUD).
* 🔄 **Smooth Environment Sync**: Weather, skybox lighting, and day counters transition smoothly across all clients without stutter or desync.
* 🌐 **ServerSync Enforced**: Configuration parameters are managed by server admins and synced to all clients automatically.
