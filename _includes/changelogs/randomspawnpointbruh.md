# 2.0.7 - Dedicated Server Spawn Point Collision Fix
* **Dedicated Server Spawn Collision Fix**:
  * Fixed an issue where multiple players connecting to a dedicated server would spawn on top of each other at identical coordinates.
  * Migrated spawn point coordinate generation from Unity's global `UnityEngine.Random` to an independently seeded `System.Random` instance, preventing Valheim's world generation routines from locking connecting clients into identical deterministic RNG sequences.
